For iOS users, notifications must be enabled to receive alerts on listening modes, memory generation, and other important updates. For Android users, notifications, location services, and disabling battery optimization are required to ensure continuous operation without system restrictions. These permissions allow Neo 1 to function seamlessly while maintaining strict privacy controls. Users can manage permissions anytime in device settings.
